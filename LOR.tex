I’ve known \textbf{Md Nafis Ul Haque Shifat} for about five years now and I’m delighted to recommend him for admission at your institution. As his English Teacher at Hasan Ali Government High School, I have had the opportunity to witness him do amazing things in and outside the classroom. The most noticeable attribute of Nafis is his enthusiasm for learning. He is consistently one of the most engaged students in my class. His questions are very thought-provoking which reflect his maturity and deeper understanding of the topics.

Nafis is academically perhaps the best student our school ever had. From sixth grade to tenth grade, among the eight exams taken in our school, Nafis stood 1st in seven of them. Not to mention, our school is considered to be the best school in Chandpur, and admission is only granted to those who perform exceptionally well on a rigorous entrance exam. Only 250 students get admitted from a pool of thousands of students. The fact that Nafis does so well in a school with such high academic standards is evidence of his excellence. I have graded his English copies in multiple exams and was impressed by his creative writing each time. Especially in the “Completing Stories” section, where we start a story with two or three lines and ask the students to finish them, I have observed his exceptional creative abilities and captivating storytelling style. His stories would always reflect out-of-the-box thinking, which would keep me engaged till the end.

Nafis is also very hard-working. Due to his involvement in numerous extracurricular activities and his participation in various camps and contests, he has had to complete the equivalent of two months of studies in a single month on several occasions. Along with his exceptional talents, he is also known for his kindness and compassion. On numerous occasions, I have seen him helping his peers grasp difficult concepts during class breaks.

Another trait of Nafis is his leadership. Nafis was his class representative from 7th grade to 10th grade. He was a great communicator and had an incredibly good relationship between his teachers and peers- exactly what we expect from a class representative. He has always been proactive in addressing various issues, which has helped us create a better learning environment. He was also in a leading position in almost every student-organized activity in our school.

Nafis is one of the founders of the Hasan Ali Government High School Science Club. He served as the Vice President of the club and played a central role in organizing a number of events. He arranged multiple workshops to encourage our students to participate in different Olympiads. In our country, as we go far from our capital Dhaka, there is an apparent decrease in participation in extracurricular activities by students. That is why such initiatives by Nafis and his friends were extremely appreciated by our school. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, they were able to host one of the largest online science festivals in our country, which was attended by our esteemed Education Minister as the chief guest. Even after leaving the school, Nafis has worked on the advisory panel of the club for a year. 

Nafis was also the first to represent our school in many national-level events. In his 9th grade, he represented our school in Inter School and College Programming Contest. Despite not having good teammates and support, his team ended up securing 4th position in that contest. From then, starting from the Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad(BdMO) to International Olympiad in Informatics(IOI), he has uplifted the name of our school many times.

Nafis is very humble and modest. In his five years of study in our school, he does not have any record of misconduct. Instead, he has won the heart of every teacher through his behavior and humbleness.

I am confident that Nafis will succeed in any future endeavors.. With his leadership, creativity, and intelligence, I am certain that he will be a great asset to any class, campus, and community. I give him my highest recommendation for admission to your institute.
